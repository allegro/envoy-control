# Timeouts

Envoy Control provides a simple and fine-grained way to configure timeouts between services. Using
Envoy's [metadata](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/base.proto#config-core-v3-metadata)
section you can provide additional configuration to the Control Plane. The information provided
in `metadata.proxy_settings` section is interpreted by Control Plane and it will create a
corresponding configuration for `Envoy`. This means that Envoy Control is stateless but in the
future there will be an override mechanism that uses a database to save the configuration.

An example configuration:

```yaml
metadata:
  proxy_settings:
    outgoing:
      dependencies:
        - service: "*"
          timeoutPolicy:
            idleTimeout: 20s
            requestTimeout: 30s
        - service: "service-a"
          timeoutPolicy:
            idleTimeout: 40s
            requestTimeout: 50s 
```
In the `outgoing` section this configuration defines `timeoutPolicy` :

* `idleTimeout` - The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests.
* `requestTimeout` - The amount of time that Envoy will wait for the entire request to be received.

More over we have option to indicate `service-a` or use `*` which will be default properties for all
other services. Last but not least if you don't provide this configuration it will use [default 
properties](https://github.com/allegro/envoy-control/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#snapshot-properties):

* `envoy-control.envoy.snapshot.egress.common-http.idle-timeout`	
* `envoy-control.envoy.snapshot.egress.common-http.request-timeout`
